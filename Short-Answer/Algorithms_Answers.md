#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime complexity is, O(n) :
    - a is equal to n * n and the while loop only runs on a single additional * n

b) Runtime complexity is, O(n^2) :
    - entering a Loop inside of a Loop that are both n based. Which means it needs to run over n * n

c) Runtime complexity is, O(n) :
    - Each the time the function will return 1 less than before, so it only needs to run as many times as initially provided.
